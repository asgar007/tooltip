# Tooltip Component Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a tooltip component in React. The tooltip component displays a tooltip when hovering over a button.

## Instructions

1. Create a React project using Create React App.
2. Create a new file called `Tooltip.js` in the `src` directory. This file contains the tooltip component implementation.
3. Create a new file called `Tooltip.css` in the `src` directory. This file contains the styles for the tooltip component.
4. In the `Tooltip.js` file, define the `Tooltip` component that takes a `position` prop and renders the tooltip accordingly.
5. In the `Tooltip.css` file, define the CSS styles for the tooltip component, including different positions and hover effects.
6. In the main component (`App.js` or any other component), import the `Tooltip` component and use it by passing the `position` prop and tooltip content.
7. Style the switch according to your preferences.
8. Run the React development server to see the tooltip component in action.

## Features

- Supports four different positions for the tooltip: top, bottom, right, and left.
- Shows the tooltip when hovering over a button.
- Allows customization of the switch and tooltip styles.

## Usage

To use the tooltip component in your React project:

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
6. You should see the tooltip component with a button. Hover over the button to see the tooltip.

## Customization

You can customize the tooltip component by modifying the CSS styles in the `Tooltip.css` file. Adjust the colors, positions, and other styles to match your desired design.

Remember to save the files after making any changes and ensure that the CSS file is properly imported into the component using the tooltip component.
